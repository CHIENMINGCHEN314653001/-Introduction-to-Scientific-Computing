Let $$g = 1$$ and prove that $$T_h g(x_j) = \frac{1}{2} x_j (1 - x_j).$$

Solution: use the definition (12.25) with $$g(x_k) = 1$$ , $$k = 1, \ldots, n-1$$  and recall that $$G^k(x_j) = h G(x_j, x_k)$$  from the exercise above. 

Then

$$
T_h g(x_j) = h \left[ \sum_{k=1}^{j} x_k (1 - x_j) + \sum_{k=j+1}^{n-1} x_j (1 - x_k) \right]
$$

from which, after straightforward computations, one gets the desired result.
