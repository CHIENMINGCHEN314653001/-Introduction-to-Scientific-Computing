Consider the boundary value problem (12.1)–(12.2) with  

$$f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x}$$

Using (12.3), prove that  

$$u(x) = -x \log(x).$$

This shows that  $$u \in C^2(0,1),$$ but $$u(0)$$ is not defined and $$u'(x), u''(x)$$ do not exist at $$x = 0$$ .

Hence, we conclude that if $$f \in C^0(0,1)$$ but not $$f \in C^0([0,1])$$ ,  then $$u$$  does not belong to $$C^0([0,1])$$ .
