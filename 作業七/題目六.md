Prove that  


$$G^k(x_j) = h \, G(x_j, x_k)$$


where $$G$$ is the Green’s function introduced in (12.4), and $$G^k$$ is its corresponding discrete counterpart solution of (12.4).

Prove the result by verifying that  

$$
L_h G = h e_k.
$$

Indeed, for a fixed $$x_k$$ , the function $$G(x_k, s)$$ is a straight line on the intervals  $$[0, x_k]$$ and $$[x_k, 1]$$ ,so that  

$$
L_h G = 0
$$

at every node $$x_l$$ with  $$l = 0, 1, \dots, k-1 \quad\text{and} \quad l= k+1, \dots, n+1.$$

Finally, a direct computation shows that  

$$
(L_h G)(x_k) = \frac{1}{h},
$$

which concludes the proof.
